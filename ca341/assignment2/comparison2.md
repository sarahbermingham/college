# Functional VS Logic
Goal: Make a BST in Haskell and Prolog

Req: insert, search, preOrder, inOrder, postOrder

## Haskell
- Talk about how functions work
- Uses recursion to loop through data structures

## Prolog
- Talk about how rules work
- Uses recursion to loop through data structures

## Implement a Delete Function
Think of the different cases:
1. Node not in tree
2. Node has no children
3. Node has one child
4. Node has two children
